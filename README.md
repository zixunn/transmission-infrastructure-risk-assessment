# Transmission Infrastructure Risk Assessment

**Geospatial Analysis of Transmission Infrastructure Risk under Land Deformation and Environmental Change**

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This project develops a comprehensive geospatial analysis framework to assess transmission infrastructure vulnerability to land deformation, environmental hazards, and vegetation encroachment using NASA OPERA InSAR data and optical remote sensing.

### Key Objectives
- **Task A**: Transmission line siting analysis using OPERA displacement data
- **Task B**: Ground deformation monitoring at critical substations  
- **Task C**: Transmission tower detection and risk assessment
- **Task D**: Vegetation encroachment monitoring along corridors

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Conda or Miniconda
- Git
- NASA Earthdata account
